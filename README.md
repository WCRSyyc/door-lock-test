# door-lock-test
Test / sample code to control a lock from a car door using an arduino (adafruit) motor shield.

Once testing is done, the door lock is used to control drum sticks for a snare (or other) drum.  See the [drumEcho](https://github.com/WCRSyyc/drumEcho) and [drummerduino](https://github.com/WCRSyyc/drummerduino) repositories.
